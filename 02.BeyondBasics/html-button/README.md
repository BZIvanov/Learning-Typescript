# About this demo

Navigate in the terminal to the folder where that package.json file is and run `npm install` in case you don't have typescript globally installed.

## Scripts

Run `npm run watch` to start the ts project. The above command will generate `main.js` in `dist` folder and watch for changes for `main.ts` file.

_Note that you have to manualy open the `index.html` file and refresh the page to see updated results. This is for simplicity, because setting up web server is out of the scope for this demo and you can easily install some package or use VS code extension._
