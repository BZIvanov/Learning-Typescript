# Hangman Game

## About the game
This is a simple JS project representing the popular game called "The Hangman Game". 

The game is about finding all the letters in a word. You have to type a single letter in the input boxes and see the result. If you have guessed a letter which the secret word contains, the correct input box will permanently show the letter and you can take another guess in the available input boxes.

If you manage to find all the correct letters in less than 10 wrong attempts you win the game. And respectively if you pick 10 letters which the secret word does not contain you will lose the game.

Also you have Hint button which will give you a better idea of what kind of word to expect to reveal.

Another button you have is the God Mode button which will reveal all the letters even if you have already lost the game so you can see the word regardless of any conditions.

Have fun playing :sun_with_face:
